# YT-Stylify

My First FireFox extension!  

## What does this do?

This extension reverts a bunch of changes that YouTube has made to their UI.  
Some changes that have been reverted by this extension are:  

- Make Subscribe/Unsubscribe button almost circular
- Make Like/Dislike button almost circular
- Add a background to video descriptions that stands out a lot  

This extension also makes video thumbnails' borders slightly curved for consistency with the rest of the site.

## What this will NOT do

This extension will NOT:

- Show dislikes on videos (there is already a great extension for that)
- Add new themes to the site
- Block ads
- Affect the content of the site in any way, only its appearance.
